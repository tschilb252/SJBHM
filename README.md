# SJBHM
San Juan River Basin Hydrology Model
The San Juan Basin Hydrology Model (SJBHM) was designed and developed for the SJRIP to be used for
long‐term planning purposes such as developing and evaluating Navajo Reservoir operating rules that
will support the goals of the SJRIP while continuing to provide reliable water supply to the basin’s water
users. The model is also used to simulate and assess the impacts of various levels of water use scenarios
on streamflows and determine how well the flow recommendations can be met at certain levels of
development.

The SJBHM consists of two distinct water resource system models that are used in a coordinated
manner. These two models are the “San Juan StateMod” model and the “SJRIP RiverWare” model and
are referred to as such throughout this documentation. These two modeling platforms are described
further below.

The primary model used for SJRIP analysis is the “SJRIP RiverWare” model, a water resource system
model built with the RiverWare modeling platform. The SJRIP RiverWare model simulates the
mainstems of the San Juan and Animas Rivers primarily in New Mexico but also includes the San Juan‐
Chama Project (SJC) diversions, the Animas‐La Plata Project (ALP) operations on the Animas River below
Durango, all of which are in Colorado, and the lower portion of the San Juan River in Utah above the
Bluff gage. This daily timestep model simulates Navajo Reservoir and its operations, including recovery
releases, flood control releases, and deliveries to both agricultural and municipal water users including
the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP) and Navajo‐Gallup Water Supply Project (NGWSP). The SJRIP
RiverWare model is not used for real‐time operations of Navajo Reservoir or any other projects in the
basin.

The State of Colorado’s “San Juan StateMod” model is used to support the SJRIP RiverWare model. This
monthly timestep model provides the boundary inflows to the SJRIP RiverWare model from its principal
runoff sources in Colorado, including the Los Pinos, Piedra, and upper San Juan Rivers that flow into
Navajo Reservoir, and the Animas, Florida, and Mancos Rivers and McElmo Creek that join the main
system below Navajo. Vallecito, Lemon, and Long Hollow reservoirs are simulated within San Juan
StateMod and their representation is considered sufficient for the SJBHM purposes. Water use and
other streamflow depletions in Colorado above the SJRIP RiverWare model’s boundary inflow nodes are
simulated within San Juan StateMod.
